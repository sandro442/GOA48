    <center><h1>1965–1966 Shelby GT350
    </h1></center>
    <p>The GT 350 made its debut in the "sportsroof" fastback model of the first generation Ford Mustang in 1965. Produced through 1966, these were the smallest and lightest of the GT 350 models. Work started at Shelby American when its Ford-powered AC Ace-based, two-seat, 289 AC Cobra sports car production was wrapping up, and the 427 cu in variant was beginning. Both the AC and the Shelby Mustang use the Cobra emblem, a similar paint scheme, and the optional "Cobra" valve covers installed on many GT350s that were part of a marketing tie-in by Shelby, as well as one of his iconic symbols. All 1965–66 cars had the Windsor 289 cu in (4.7 L) HiPo K-Code 271 hp (202 kW; 275 PS) V8 engine, modified with a large 4-barrel Holley 725 CFM carburetor to produce 306 bhp (310 PS; 228 kW) at 6,000 rpm and 329 lb⋅ft (446 N⋅m) of torque at 4,200 rpm.[3][4] Marketing literature referred to this engine as the "Cobra hi-riser" due to its high-rise intake manifold. Beginning as a stock Mustang with a 4-speed manual transmission and 9-inch live rear axle, the cars were shipped to Shelby American, where they received the high-rise manifolds, Tri-Y headers, and were given larger Ford Galaxie rear drum brakes with metallic-linings and Kelsey-Hayes front disc brakes.

        The 1965 GT350 was built for the race track, not comfort or ease of driving. A total of 34 race-spec "GT350R" cars were built specifically for competition use under SCCA rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years.[5] The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including a rear seat, optional colors, and an optional automatic transmission. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, at the cost of their competitiveness. By 1969 Carroll Shelby was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford, with the 1969 GT350s and GT500s reduced to being largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang.
        
        The 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford's San Jose Assembly Plant for modification by Shelby, originally in Venice Beach and later at Los Angeles International Airport. San Jose cars carried an "R" in the Ford VIN denoting that facility.[6] The only year that Shelby Mustangs from the 1960s came from another plant was 1968, where they came from New Jersey, "T" in the VIN,[7] and were modified by A.O. Smith.
        
        1965 GT350
        All 1965 GT350s were painted in Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Approximately 28% of the 562 1965 cars built were delivered to the dealer with the optional Le Mans stripes, a pair of broad matching blue stripes that run the length of the entire car from the hood through the roof and the tail.[8] Today, it is difficult to find a GT350 without them.[citation needed]. In subsequent years white stripes were also used with dark colored body paint.
        
        Many early 1965 cars had the battery relocated to the trunk, which was changed mid-year due to complaints of fumes, and had over-rider traction bars, relocated A-arms, as well as other modifications. A 4-speed Borg-Warner T10 manual was the only transmission available. Dual exhausts exited out the sides via glasspack mufflers (with fourteen cars being equipped with rear-exiting exhausts to meet state regulations for sales in certain areas). For this one year, the GT350 also had special 130 mph (210 km/h)-rated Goodyear "Blue Dot" tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 GT350 had a full-size spare tire mounted in place of rear seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to qualify as a "sports car" under SCCA regulations), and rode on either silver-painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center "Cragar Shelby" 15-inch rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized "CS". Total 1965 model year production was 562 units.
        For 1966, the GT350 lost its Mustang tag and was marketed simply as the Shelby GT350.[9] The new model year also saw the introduction of non-white colors, including blue, red, green, and black. Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed automatic, as well as an optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated to the trunk for 1966, and the over-rider traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later engines were painted regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear.

The first 252 GT350s for 1966 began as 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks that had been specifically ordered by Shelby American for conversion into 1966 GT350s; these all had 1965 bodies.[citation needed] They were received in blocks of cars; thus Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order to Ford factory VINs.

As a promotional move, Ford leveraged its role as the major shareholder of Hertz to persuade the rental car giant to purchase 1,003 fastbacks, including two prototypes. Four "experimental" GT350 convertibles were also built for test purposes in anticipation of a 1967-1/2 convertible offering.[10] A small number of the consumer sales 1966 models were factory fitted with Paxton superchargers, but not the No-Spin limited slip differential, for an additional $670, (~$6,292 in 2023) the engine was rated at 440 hp (328 kW).[11][12][13] Total production for 1966 was 2,378 units, including two prototypes and four drag cars, with 1,372 sold to the general public.
