    <p>Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel
        single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA
        Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of racing since its inaugural running
        in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. A Formula
        One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and
        continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

        A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one
        for the constructors (the teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing
        licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on grade one tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues
        for tracks.

        Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to very high cornering speeds
        achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear
        wings. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control,
        and automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were briefly
        reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.[1]

        With the average annual cost of running a team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—at
        approximately £220,000,000 (or $265,000,000),[2] Formula One's financial and political battles are widely
        reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm
        CVC Capital Partners for £6.4 billion ($8 billion).

        <h1>History</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Formula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers' Championship
        (1931–1939). The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula
        agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new
        regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start. Before World War II, a
        number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European
        Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars
        did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to
        commence in 1950.

        The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United
        Kingdom on 13 May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship,
        narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and
        1957. This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46
        years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.Formula One originated from the World

    <p>Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is
        widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is.[23][24] When
        Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association,
        and in 1978, he became its president.[25] Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and
        negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to "hunt as a pack" through FOCA.He offered
        Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that
        was required was to surrender trackside advertising.

        The formation of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA–FOCA war,
        during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and
        technical regulations.[26] The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley "used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war
        with a very long-term aim in view". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and
        FISA withdrew its sanction from races.The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical
        stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations.[27] Although FISA asserted its right
        to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.[28]

        FISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983. But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault
        had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW
        turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated[who?] to be over 970 kW
        (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW
        (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar.These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit
        racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in 1984, and
        boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in 1989.

        The development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active
        suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was
        driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed
        suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints
        that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994
        season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very "twitchy" and difficult
        to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they "proved difficult to police
        effectively".

        The teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.
        On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during
        the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and
        Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while
        Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles (nine constructors' and seven
        drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and
        continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing
        into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety
        standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday
        qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years
        until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off
        the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the
        2000 Italian Grand Prix, one at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.

        Since Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that
        otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams—most notably the
        changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a
        narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to
        reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch
        between tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety
        Results were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the
        deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic
        devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car
        turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to
        make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a
        harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of
        aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.

        Drivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the "Big Four", won every World
        Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship from 1979 to 2008, as well as
        placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between 1989 and
        1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997. Due to the
        technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus
        increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car
        manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain
        competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.
