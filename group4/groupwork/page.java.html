        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core
        technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
        behavior.

        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized
        in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).

        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

    </center>
    <hr>

    <h2>Creation at Netscape</h2>
    <section name="" id="Creation at Netscape">
        <p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to
            non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead
            developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape
            Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

            During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
            behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development
            scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator.
            They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language,
            while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.

            The goal was a "language for the masses", "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".
            Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
            similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its
            interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in
            September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.

            The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the
            time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name
            a marketing ploy by Netscape.</p>

        <h1>Adoption by Microsoft</h1>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front,
        Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.

        Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of
        these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator. These differences
        made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of
        "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.</p>
    <section id="The rise of JScript"></section>
    <h1>The rise of JScript</h1>

    <p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard
        specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first
        ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

        The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3
        in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.

        However, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly
        dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.
        This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.

        Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript
        language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.</p>
    </section>
    <center><button><a href="#top">return to top</a></button></center>
    <section id="Growth and standardization">

        <h1>Growth and standardization</h1>

        <p>During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This
            started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox
            was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.

            In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This
            led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X
            in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing
            ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an
            open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side
            scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.

            Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA
            work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a
            set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be
            loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of
            JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new
            libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.

            Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its
            competition. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser vendors needed to
            overhaul their engines for JIT.

            In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual
            agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the
            ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.</p>

    <section id="Reaching maturity">
        <h1>Reaching maturity</h1>
        <p>Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of
            additions
            and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.

            The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript
            outside
            of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone
            JavaScript runtime system. As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers, and npm had the most
            modules of any package manager in the world.

            The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via
            regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal
            process. Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.

            The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and
            substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and
            other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.</p>

        <p>Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side

            jQuery is by far the most-used. Other notable ones include Angular, Bootstrap, Lodash, Modernizr, React,
            Underscore, and Vue. Multiple options can be used in conjunction, such as jQuery and Bootstrap.

            However, the term "Vanilla JS" was coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead
            relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.</p>

    <section id="Other usage">
        <h1>Other usage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a
            variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.

            Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's
            Internet Information Services, but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually started to grow in
            the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.

            Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications
            with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for
            scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.

            JavaScript has been used in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript engine</h2>
        <p>This section is an excerpt from JavaScript engine.
            A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were
            mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.

            JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a
            browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model and
            Web IDL bindings. However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for example, the V8
            engine is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.

            Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript, ECMAScript engine is another name for
            these implementations. With the advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code in the same
            sandbox as regular JavaScript cod</p>

    <section id="Runtime system"></section>
    <h1>Runtime system</h1>
    <p>A JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to
        enable scripts to interact with the broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for
        input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts.

        JavaScript is a single-threaded language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and it
        calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and
        local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty
        upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop,
        described as "run to completion" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered.
        However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed
        using events and callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while
        waiting for a database query to return information.</p>

    <section id="Imperative and structured">
        <h2>Imperative and structured</h2>
        <p>Main article: Structured programming</p>
        <p>JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., <button>if</button> statements,
            <button>while</button> loops, <button>switch</button> statements, <button>do while</button> loops, etc.).
            One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with <button>var</button>;
            block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords <button>let</button> and
            <button>const</button>. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One
            syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate
            statements) to be omitted.

    <h1>Weakly typed</h1>
    <p>Main article: Weakly typed</p>
    <p>JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.</p>
    </section>
    <ul>
        <li>The binary <button>+</button>operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This
            is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator.</li>
        <li>The binary <button>-</button> operator always casts both operands to a number</li>
        <li>Both unary operators <button>(+, -)</button> always cast the operand to a number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Values are cast to strings like the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Strings are left as-is
        </li>
        <li>Numbers are converted to their string representation</li>
        <li>Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas <button>(,)</button>

        </li>
        <li>Other objects are converted to the string <button>[object Object]</button> where Object is the name of the
            constructor of the object</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be
        modified by defining <button>toString</button> and <button>valueOf </button>functions on the prototype for
        string and number casting respectively.

        JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can
        be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a
        string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a
        number before performing subtraction.</p>

    </a>
    <p>Often also mentioned is <button> {} + [] </button>
        resulting in <button>0</button> (number). This is misleading: the <button>{}</button> is interpreted as an empty
        code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary
        <button>+</button> operator. If the expression is wrapped in parentheses - <button>({} + [])</button> – the
        curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is <button>"[object
            Object]"</button> as expected.

        <p>JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather

            string.JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.</p>

    <section id="bject-orientation (prototype-based)"></section>
    <h2>Object-orientation (prototype-based)</h2>
    <p>Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:</p><br>
    <br>
    <p>You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment
        the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects.
        We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object
        oriented than that?[61]

        In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the
        name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation
        <button>(obj.x = 10)</button> and bracket notation <button>(obj['x'] = 10)</button>. A property may be added,
        rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's
        prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a <button>for...in</button> loop.

    <section id="Prototypes">
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p>Main article: Prototype-based programming</p>
        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for
            inheritance. It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Functions as object constructors">
        <h2>Functions as object constructors</h2>
        <p>Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new
            will
            create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including
            properties
            from the <button>Object</button> prototype). ECMAScript 5 offers the <button>Object.create </button>method,
            allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the <button>Object</button>
            prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to <button>null</button>). The constructor's
            <button>prototype</button> property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New
            methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in
            constructors, such as <button>Array</button> or <button>Object</button>, also have prototypes that can be
            modified. While it is possible to modify the <button>Object</button>
            prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods
            and
            properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.

        <p>Unlike in many object-oriented languages, in <strong>JavaScript</strong> there is no distinction between a
            function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling. When a

    <p>A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is
        invoked.

        In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including

            <p><button>JavaScript</button> natively supports various function-based implementations of Role patterns
                like Traits and Mixins. Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the

                explicitly via <button>call</button> or <button>apply</button> to objects that need to feature
                additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.

        <section id="Object composition and inheritance">
            <h2>Object composition and inheritance</h2>
            <p>Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation
                already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be
                related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this
                object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to
                the prototype property of constructor functions.</p>

            <p>JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client
                computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a
                sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like
                creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do
                not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most
                JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.

                There are subsets of general JavaScript—ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)—that provide greater levels of
                security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements). Closure Toolkit is
                another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.

                Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a

        <section id="Cross-site scripting">
            <h2>Cross-site scripting</h2>
            <p>A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the
                same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an
                online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script
                in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially
                disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. One important
                solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization.

                Some browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a
                URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS
                attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web
                applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.

                XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.</p>

                transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication,
                requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the
                initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form
                field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects.

            <h2>Misplaced trust in the client</h2>
            <p>Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control
                of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or
                at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some
                implications are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Website authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code
                    must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies
                    that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that
                    should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as
                    right-clicking on an image to save it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript
                    because it can be extracted by an attacker.

            <h2>Misplaced trust in developers</h2>
            <p>Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems
                allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program
                libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date,
                but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon
                libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely
                upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In
                a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a
                library with at least one known vulnerability. "The median lag between the oldest library version used
                on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development
                of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago." Another possibility is that the maintainer of a
                library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his
                repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries
                to break.

            <h1>Browser and plugin coding errors</h1>
            <p>JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws
                such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they
                wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For
                example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API
                with superuser privileges.

                These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.

                Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default
                in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been
                exploited in the past).

                In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by
                running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges. Google Chrome similarly confines its page
                renderers to their own "sandbox".</p>

            <h2>Sandbox implementation errors</h2>
            <p>Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for
                example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.

                Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both
                Internet Explorer and Firefox. In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in
                Internet Explorer.

                Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as
                general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like
                VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are
                uncommon in practice.</p>

            <h1>Related technologies</h1>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>A common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax
                (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed,
                and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java
                keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming
                conventions, and JavaScript'<button> Math</button> and <button>Date</button> objects are based on
                classes from Java 1.0.

                Both languages first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and
                JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.

                The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static
                typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is
                loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are
                prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has
                done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.</p>

                WebAssembly, which runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.
